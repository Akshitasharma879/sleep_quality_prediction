# sleep_quality_prediction
 
This project focuses on predicting sleep quality using regression-based machine learning techniques. The dataset includes lifestyle and health-related features such as age, stress level, sleep duration, BMI category, heart rate, physical activity level, and daily steps. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering (including blood pressure splitting and encoding), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand relationships between variables. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated, with hyperparameter tuning applied to improve performance. The final model predicts sleep quality scores and helps identify key factors influencing healthy sleep patterns.
