# sleep_quality_prediction
This project predicts sleep quality based on lifestyle and health-related factors. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of correlations between features. A machine learning model is trained to classify and predict sleep quality, helping understand key factors that impact healthy sleep patterns.
